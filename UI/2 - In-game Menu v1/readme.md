# UI 1 - Main Menu v1
The first version contains the UI implementation of the main menu, credits and options menu. For now most of the main menu functionality is ready, and for the options I have only implemented the template, but until I don't know the game specific options I won't modify it.

## Main menu
- The buttons that open panels or prompts are working
- The animation to change between main menu, credits and options are working

### TODO
- Add smooth transitions when opening and closing panels and sub-menus
- Add sounds when hovering over buttons
- Change text font and size
- Change menu colors to blue

## Credits (starting screen)
For now only the game's title is displayed at the top and then my only credit and at the bottom a return button.

### TODO
- Add smooth transitions and a timeline to first show the game title and then each credit
- Add a "Escape" key event to exit the credits
- Chage text font and size

## Options (starting menu)
Like I said most of the options in this menu are the ones that come with the UI template asset, so I will change them in a later stage.

### TODO
- Change options sub-menus
- Change text font and size
